 I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Seoul National University, advised by professor Donjun Lee. My research goal is to develop an interactive simulator capable of handling large-scale contact-rich environments involving both rigid and deformable objects â€” for example, a soft human hand tightening a bolt. Toward this goal, my interests include dynamics modeling, parallelizable solvers, and GPU-accelerated computation.
